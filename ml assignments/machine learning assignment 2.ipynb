In reinforcement learning, a penalty is imposed in the training phase for every wrong prediction or classification, in other words it sets the algorithm one step back. A reward is gained for every correct prediction or classification, which means the algorithm goes one step ahead towards making itself more effective. Hundreds of such iterations are performed over and over for the model to become ready."
